Google had removed extension from webstore, and I don't care enough for now to argue with support about it. Maybe one day, when I enhance rikaigu to the degree I was planning...

rikaigu
=


Enhanced version of rikaikun - translate Japanese by hovering over words. Now with banana flavor!

## Building

You'll need **make**, **curl**, **python3** and [**emcc**](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten). From repo root execute:
```bash
rikiagu/$ make
```

Then you can '*load unpacked extension*' from Chrome.
