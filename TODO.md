* Nice info for expressions.
* Documentation + second content script refactoring.
* Tests for everything (scripts and expression).
* Build scripts.
* crfpp suck. Especially it's memory management. It would be nice to find other usable implementation.
* Check if TreeWalker is really necessary or simple iteration through DOM would be fast enough.
* Generate kanji.dat. KANJIDIC is good enough, but Wiktionary (en and jp) has entries it hasn't.
* Japanese dictionary (lexicon). Sanseido is fine if it has offline version, but I prefer Wiktionary.
* Russian dictionary? And l10n then, I guess?
* Compile to WebAssembly and use it, when support detected.
* Extract and process text from pictures!
