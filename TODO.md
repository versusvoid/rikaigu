- [ ] Ranking of displayed entries
- [ ] Smart segmentation
- [ ] IndexedDB or any other way to reduce memory usage
- [ ] Basic review list functionality (add, remove, show list for current sentence, highlight?)
- [ ] Learning page for review list (flashcards, srs, you name it)
- [ ] Generate kanji.dat. KANJIDIC is good enough, but Wiktionary (en and jp) has entries it hasn't
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Fix double UTF conversion (to UTF-8 when calling cpp code and back to UTF-16 in cpp code.
It's not that slow, just ugly)
- [ ] Check if TreeWalker is really necessary or simple iteration through DOM would be fast enough
- [ ] Japanese dictionary (lexicon). Sanseido is fine if it has offline version, but I prefer Wiktionary
- [ ] Russian dictionary (https://warodai.ru/download/)? And l10n then, I guess?
- [ ] Extract and process text from pictures!
